# CRUD_Practice
**Note to Clint**

I wanted to use my code from Wednesday as my starting point so worked from there. 
While I was able to build an app that updates, deletes, creates, and reads my "tasks" psql database, I used exclusively get and post.
For some reason "patch" and "delete" didn't want to work for me. Let me know if you have any suggestions.
I will spend a partof my weekend trying to figure this out.
